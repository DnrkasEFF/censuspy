============
CensusPy
============
The goal of CensusPy is to expose the vast amount of data the government collects on US citizens to the broader programming community.

Written as a wrapper around existing census APIs, v0.1 of CensusPy currently supports the `Business Dynamics Statistics <https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/business-dynamics.html>`_ database. But, the end goal will be to support all databases provided by the Census Bureau.

Installation
===============
CensusPy is supported on PyPi, so installation is as simple as::

  pip install censuspy

CensusPy only supports Python >= 3.3

Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS)
===================================

Quickstart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Initialize the BDS object using your API key & geographic level of query::

  import censuspy
  bds = censuspy.bds(api_key=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE], geo='state')

Pull total employment numbers for Massachusetts (FIPS code 25) in 2014::

  ma_emp = bds.get(metric='emp', code=25, time=2014)
  print(ma_emp)

Reference Materials

* List of available metrics/variables: http://bit.ly/2GvGDIE
* FIPS State Codes: http://bit.ly/2EUgw1c

Goals
===============
Broadly speaking, my goal is to cover all the business-focused datasets before moving to the purely demographic data. The main motivation behind that is personal, since I'm deriving personal value from developing this wrapper. That being said -- if there is significant interest in exposing a specific dataset, then I'm more than happy to entertain that as well. Please feel free to send any requests to dnrkaseff360@gmail.com.

**Roadmap**:

* Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs (March 2018)
* County Business Patterns and Nonemployer Statistics (April 2018)
* Economic Census (May 2018)
* Economic Indicators (June 2018)
